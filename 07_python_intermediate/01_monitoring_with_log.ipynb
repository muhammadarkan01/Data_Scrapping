    "### **Introduction to Python Logging**\n",
    "\n",
    "The logging module in Python provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from your code. Logs are essential for understanding and debugging your program, especially in production environments or when you're working with complex systems like web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Use Logging?**\n",
    "1. **Debugging:** Helps in tracking program execution without cluttering the code with `print()` statements.\n",
    "2. **Persistence:** Logs can be saved to a file, enabling analysis after the program finishes.\n",
    "3. **Control:** You can set logging levels to filter messages based on their importance.\n",
    "4. **Structured Output:** With proper configuration, logs can include timestamps, severity levels, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic Concepts in Logging**\n",
    "1. **Loggers:** The main entry point for logging. You can think of them as entities that emit log messages.\n",
    "2. **Handlers:** Define where the log messages go (console, file, etc.).\n",
    "3. **Levels:** Determine the severity of a log message. Common levels are:\n",
    "   - `DEBUG`: Detailed information for diagnosing problems.\n",
    "   - `INFO`: Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",
    "   - `WARNING`: An indication of something unexpected or an issue that isn’t critical yet.\n",
    "   - `ERROR`: A serious problem that prevents the program from continuing.\n",
    "   - `CRITICAL`: A very serious error, often indicating a program crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic Logging Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how to get started with Python's logging module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set up a basic logger\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(\n",
    "    level=logging.DEBUG,  # Set the minimum logging level\n",
    "    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'  # Define the log message format\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example log messages\n",
    "logging.debug(\"This is a debug message. Used for detailed diagnostic output.\")\n",
    "logging.info(\"This is an info message. Indicates the program is running as expected.\")\n",
    "logging.warning(\"This is a warning message. Something unexpected happened.\")\n",
    "logging.error(\"This is an error message. A problem occurred.\")\n",
    "logging.critical(\"This is a critical message. A serious error happened.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Output Explanation**\n",
    "When you run the code, you'll see output like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "2024-12-23 14:23:01,123 - DEBUG - This is a debug message. Used for detailed diagnostic output.\n",
    "2024-12-23 14:23:01,124 - INFO - This is an info message. Indicates the program is running as expected.\n",
    "2024-12-23 14:23:01,125 - WARNING - This is a warning message. Something unexpected happened.\n",
    "2024-12-23 14:23:01,126 - ERROR - This is an error message. A problem occurred.\n",
    "2024-12-23 14:23:01,127 - CRITICAL - This is a critical message. A serious error happened.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Timestamp:** Indicates when the log was recorded.\n",
    "- **Log Level:** Shows the severity of the log message.\n",
    "- **Message:** The custom message provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Functions**\n",
    "1. **`logging.basicConfig()`**: Sets up the configuration for logging.\n",
    "2. **Logging methods:** These emit messages with a severity level:\n",
    "   - `logging.debug()`\n",
    "   - `logging.info()`\n",
    "   - `logging.warning()`\n",
    "   - `logging.error()`\n",
    "   - `logging.critical()`"
